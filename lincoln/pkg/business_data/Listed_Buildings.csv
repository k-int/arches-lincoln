Architect Sam Scorer of Denis Clarke Hall, Scorer and Bright. Walls rendered to lower parts, glazed to upper parts (including a wall of stained glass), beneath a concrete hyperbolic paraboloid roof, covered externally in aluminium sheets. PLAN: hexagonal plan, designed on the principle that the whole congregation should be gathered round the sanctuary and altar area and have a clear view of everything that is done there. EXTERIOR: the exterior is dominated by the saddle-like shape of the hyperbolic paraboloid roof, which rises to east and west and sweeps down to ground level points to north and south (at each point there being a small pool). Western entrance via porch with projecting canopy with segmental underside to front plane. INTERIOR: internally the roof is varnished boarding. The altar is placed in a circular sanctuary area to the eastern side of the hexagon, and is raised on 4 steps. The fixed pews of light-coloured varnished wood are curved to describe a part-circular formation on a floor which slopes gently downwards towards the sanctuary. The font is placed in the central aisle, in front of the altar. Font, altar and pulpit are &#39;chunky&#39; in form and are designed by the architect in concrete. The sanctuary is surrounded by a painted metal rail with a shelf, and the sanctuary and raised strip behind are also partly enclosed by a simple painted metal rail; the latter railings, to left and right of the sanctuary, have affixed to them a pair of large metal candlesticks of abstract design, by the sculptor Charles Edward Sansbury, who also designed the 2 smaller candlesticks of twisted and welded metal and matching Processional Cross. The upper part of the east wall is fully glazed and comprises an abstract stained-glass window by the artist Keith New. The building is a major contribution to church architecture of this period, combining innovative architectural thinking with advanced liturgical planning, and a complete set of original fittings, including artist-designed stained glass and metalwork of high quality.<br />

<p>HISTORY: St Mary&#39;s Guildhall may well be &quot; the only survivor from the small group of the king&#39;s town houses which existed in several major towns....St Mary&#39;s Guildhall is a domestic complex on a palatial scale, indicating the highest social status, and as such is representative of a little known urban building type. &quot; ( Stocker) It was used from 1251 to 1547 as the headquarters of the Great Guild of St Mary, Lincoln&#39;s most important guild, and began to be used as a maltings during this time. It was remodelled early in the C17 for the Bluecoat School, and was subsequently adapted for industrial uses, mainly malting. Scheduled Ancient Monument, County No.46.
