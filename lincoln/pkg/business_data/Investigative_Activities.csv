The boreholes were used to create an indicative deposit model for the site of the University of Lincoln&#39;s Sarah Swift development. The deposit model indicated that the west of the site was likely to be situated above deep deposits of river silts. Moving eastwards, the silts give way to peats, and finally to organic soils at the eastern end of the site. Strong evidence for post medieval structural remains was observed, with circumstantial evidence for early medieval industrial processes in the vicinity. The central portion of the site appeared to have strong potential for Roman structural remains associated with the use of the riverbank, indicated by the presence of substanital amounts of waterlogged wood. The presence of waterlogged remains was a key finding of the survey.</p>

Strong results were achieved over the area of known Roman settlement and industry, although the edges of the site could not be defined due to possible alluvial cover to the north of the Catchwater Drain. The results included several north-south aligned rectilinear enclosure complexes, with internal divisions apparent, between 10 and 30 kilns or other heat affected structures, and connecting trackways. THe site was interpreted as being of several phases.&nbsp;The survey was also effective over the known medieval site at Haw Hill, revealing possible foundation trenches&nbsp;and areas of possible demolition spreads.</p>

The excavation took the form of a single large L-shaped trench, with two areas of deeper excavation undertaken within the wider excavated area. This enabled deeper deposits to be investigated using a steeped trench for safety. 578 individual contexts were recorded, and these were grouped into 215 context groups (CGs) and 67 land-use blocks (LUBs) in line with the recording methods used at the time. Finds included over 2000 roman sherds, and over 2500 post-roman sherds, as well as around 2400 fragments of building material. The latter were mostly of post-Roman date, and were largely discarded on site. There were also 750 registered small finds, primarily iron objects.</p>

<p>Post excavation interpretation of the site indicates that the earliest deposits were a seties of dumps dating to the early Roman period. These were followed by a probable terrace wall, which was used to relandscape the area. A roman structure was built against the terrace wall and was in use from the early 2nd century until the middle of the 3rd century. THis was superseded by several more Roman buildings, which appear to have been in use from the later 3rd century. No firm evidence was recovered to indicate when the structures went out of use, but it appears that their foundations were robbed in the early medieval period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A group of early medieval features, including one or two&nbsp;sunken-floored buildings, and a probable timber structure, were also identified. Although the dating evidence for this phase of occupation was sparse, the assemblage recovered from one of the possible SFBs indicated an early-mid 10th century date. From the later medieval period, a number of relatively high-status stone buildings were identified, with an unusually high proportion of glazed roof tile fragments. It is likely that these structures were in use between the 12th and 15th centuries.</p>

<p>Evidence for post-medieval and modern archaeological remains on the site is somewhat sparse, owing to the excavation techniques employed and the prioritisation of deeper and older deposits by the excavators. However, there was evidence for a number of industrial features from the post-medieval period, including a lime kiln.&nbsp;</p>
